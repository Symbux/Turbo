# How to contribute

We follow a simple fork and pull request based contribution system.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/Symbux/Turbo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Getting started

* [Issues Guidelines](https://github.com/Symbux/Turbo/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)

## Coding conventions

We follow some fairly different coding styles, please make sure your IDE/Code editor has an installed eslint plugin that uses our eslint file.

Additionally some differences between our code and most common projects:

* We use tabs over spaces, this is because tabs are controllable sizing and helps with people who have issues with vision. [More Info](https://dev.to/alexandersandberg/why-we-should-default-to-tabs-instead-of-spaces-for-an-accessible-first-environment-101f)
* We use [tsdoc](https://tsdoc.org/) to help make our code easier to read, alongside offer help to editors for hinting.
* We like to use comments, the general rule is, if something is not obvious comment the nearest block, i.e. if you have 4 lines of code that do something, comment it, makes it easier to come back to.
