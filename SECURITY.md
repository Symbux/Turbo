# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Upon release, we will define a series of LTS versions, each LTS version will be
supported for security fixes for a year. All other versions have a 3 month support
cycle.

> We aim to support backwards compatability, therefore making it easy for you to upgrade.

Example below:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |
